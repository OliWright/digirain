# Matrix Digital Rain
This is a tiny implementation of the Digital Rain effect from the Matrix.  It's really designed for an IBM PC or PC/XT (5150 or 5160), with an MDA card attached to a 5151 monitor.

The 5151 is a green-screen monitor with a high persistence phosphor.  That means it has an afterglow.

Most Digital Rain implementations simulate this afterglow.  This implementation however completely relies on the afterglow being a real effect of the monitor.
